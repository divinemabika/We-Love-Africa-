    <h2>Educating Africa!</h2>
    <p>BUILD, STRENGTHEN AND EMPOWER!</p>
    <p> Educating Africa and what it aims to do is give Africans the best possible education whether it is in a formal setting or an informal setting. I have realised that within trying to educate people from Africa through development education and global learning, they are being taught a lot of things that have derived from the countries in the Global North.
       They will learn about their history, read books from European writers, learning about the conditions in their country and an example of this is Chimanda Adiche The danger of a single story. The Nigerian author, in her TED talk refers to her childhood education, where she learnt much more about snow, raining and life in the UK through English literature than she did about the history and culture of her own country. It is not therefore surprising that to this day the influence of the UK education system can be seen in countries as diverse as Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, India and Pakistan.</p>

    <h2>Library Project</h2>

    <p>To build libraries/donate books to improve childrenâ€™s literacy and knowledge. Having access to a library is providing fun and interesting books for men, women and children to spark their imagination and promote a lifelong love of reading, learning and making a difference. Having all different types of books encourage independent learning, intellectual curiosity a passion for reading and a passion to inspire a community.
       We will provide a range of local language and national language books including history, culture, science, short stories and more.
      We will also provide books in English where people are able to learn and expand their language vocabulary.
      There will be books for young readers as well as for the older readers.</p>

    <h2>Wider Horizons</h2>
    <p>The idea here is to partner up with tops schools in the countries and see if they are able to able to train teachers in rural schools and those aspiring to become teachers. It is also about being able to go into libraries and teaching people how the library works, locating books and how these books can help in learning and making difference.
       What this project will eventually aim to do is send children to school for those who cannot afford it.
       It is about giving Africans the opportunities they did not have to make their county a better place and
       give them the opportunities to show us their talents.</p>
